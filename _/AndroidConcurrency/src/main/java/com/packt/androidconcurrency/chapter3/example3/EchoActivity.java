/**
 * Illustrates sending messages from a background thread for
 * handling by the main thread.
 *
 * Notice that we prevent memory leaks by attaching and
 * detaching during lifecycle callbacks so that we can release
 * references to the view hierarchy.
 *
 * Notice also that we are using blocking operations to
 * accept a socket connection and read lines of text from
 * the socket, so we MUST do this in a background thread.
 *
 * These blocking operations would at best make our user-
 * interface unresponsive, and probably cause ANR's if we
 * use them from the main thread (actually if we try to
 * use these particular blocking operations the system will
 * immediately raise a NetworkOnMainThreadException if we're
 * running Honeycomb or newer!)
 *
 * To see the example in action, first start the activity on
 * your device, then open a terminal/command-prompt on your
 * development computer.
 *
 * On your device screen you should see text something like:
 *
 *   "telnet 192.168.0.4 4444"
 *
 * Enter this text at the command-prompt on your desktop machine.
 * The command prompt should then display text something like:
 *
 *   Trying 192.168.0.4...
 *   Connected to 192.168.0.4.
 *   Escape character is '^]'.
 *
 * ... and your device screen should now say "hello"
 *
 * Now any text you enter at the command-prompt should appear
 * on your device screen. Enter "bye" to disconnect.
